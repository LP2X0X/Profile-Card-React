### ðŸ§  What I've learned from this project:

- I implemented React components and learned how to pass data using props.
- I reinforced my understanding of CSS variables.
- I explored how flex-wrap works for creating responsive layouts.

- I improved the code by using list rendering and short-circuit evaluation for a cleaner and more concise implementation.
